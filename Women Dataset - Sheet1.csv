Ronda Rousey,Sportswomen,"In a brutal sport dominated by men, “Rowdy” Ronda Rousey has emerged as one of the biggest stars in MMA. Her penchant for trash-talking her opponents before brutally submitting them with her trademark armbar has definitely pushed her into villain territory. It’'s territory Rousey seems to relish. Since making her amateur debut in 2010, Rousey’'s career has skyrocketed. In November 2012 she became the first female fighter to sign with the UFC. Three months later she became the first female fighter to headline a UFC event. To date she’'s 9-0 (eight submissions and a TKO) and the No. 1 pound-for-pound female MMA fighter in the world. Rousey’'s influence extends well beyond the Octagon. She gets regular modeling work and had a memorable appearance in ESPN The Magazine’'s annual ""Body Issue"" in 2012. Rousey speaks repeatedly of the importance of independence, of how women should not be ‘'do-nothings’' and ‘'take care of themselves’'. In a world where pictures, film and media rhetoric constantly give women the idea that they must ‘'be'’ a certain way in order to be ‘'liked’', she gives them the all-important message that the most important thing in the world is to be oneself – for nobody else, a message that will go a long way in helping women world-over build a self-belief they may not have previously had. Not only is she at the top of her game, she has been through immense trials to get there. There are still several battles she fights along the way, but she is fearless about them all. “I don't shy away from any questions. I'm not scared of any question. I'll give you an answer. A lot of people are scared of having actual opinions out there. People are so scared of criticism... I''m not scared of people disliking me.”

She finished in a national record time of 58.76. Throughout the Olympics, her cheerful interviews and goofy demeanor made her very popular.

Neither of her parents had much of an athletic background, but Fu’s father sent his daughter to a local swimming school at the age of five to try to slowly improve her breathing. Fu, who reportedly suffered from asthma since childhood, eventually made a name for herself in the junior circles.

Ayogo software developer Stacey Vachon found a few famous quotes by Admiral Hopper: “If it’s a good idea, go ahead and do it.
